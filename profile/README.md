![2060 logo](assets/2060_logo.svg)

Open-source tools that enable building Verifiable Credential solutions embedding [OpenID for Verifiable Credentials](https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/) and [didcomm](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging)-based auditable chat messaging services, combining text, pictures, videos, voice, biometric user authentication, and more.

Create anonymous, decentralized, sophisticated and interoperable Verifiable Credentials Services by using our open source service agent, 2060-service-agent, based on Openwallet [credo-ts](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts).
Deliver various types of credentials to end-users, including identity cards, badges, graduation certificates, and many other types of credentials.

Verify trusted credentials issued by your organization or your partners, to secure the authentication of connections to your products and services.

Perform biometric authentication to compare user's face with embedded photo in Verifiable Credential.

And many more!
