# Verifiable Credentials & Authentic Data

Open-source tools that enable building rich decentralised chat-powered services, combining text, pictures, videos and voice based on Verifiable Credentials and [didcomm](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging).

Create anonymous, decentralised, sophisticated and interoperable chat connections between Users and Services by using our open source service agent, [2060-service-agent](https://github.com/2060-io/2060-service-agent), based on [aries-framework-javascript](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript).

Deliver various types of credentials to end-users, including identity cards, banking cards, graduation certificates, and many other types of credentials.

Verify trusted credentials issued by your organisation or your partners, to secure the authentication of connections to your products and services.
